# ==================================
# Local config (often environment-specific)
appsettings.Development.json
secret.json

# If you have other environment-specific appsettings (e.g., Staging, Production):
appsettings.*.json
# But keep the main appsettings.json in source control:
!appsettings.json

# launchSettings.json can be optional:
# Some teams prefer to keep it in source control for consistent dev environments.
# If you want to ignore it, uncomment the following line:
# Properties/launchSettings.json
